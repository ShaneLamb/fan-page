        <h2>Why not just take a Staycation?</h2>
        <p>First of all let me say that staycations can be a great way to spend a little time off, however I find being away from
            <br> my home more to my liking. You can argue by definition every time we go to work or school that we are traveling
            <br> so what is the big deal? While this is technically travel it is mechanical, souless, unless of course you pass by some
            <br> great scenery every day for example if you lived in Duluth. Travel is a great way to step away from the familiar,
            <br> meet new people and learn more about yourself. If you can find time to get away whether it be locally, across
            <br> the country, or across the world, then take the chance and make some memories.

        <p id="new">While I love traveling through the US, international travel has always been number one in my mind, plus I met my wife abroad so I am a little biased. If you are also interested in travel and want to discuss it my email is at the bottom of the page. Happy Trails!</p>
