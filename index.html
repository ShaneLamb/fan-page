            <h2>Why not just take a Staycation?</h2>
             <p>First of all let me say that staycations can be a great way to spend a little time off, however I find being away from my home more to my liking. You can argue by definition every time we go to work or school that we are traveling so what is the big deal? While this is technically travel it is mechanical, souless, unless of course you pass by some great scenery every day for example if you lived in Duluth. Travel is a great way to step away from the familiar, meet new people and learn more about yourself. If you can find time to get away whether it be locally, across the country, or across the world, then take the chance and make some memories. Would you like to know more?

            <p id="new">While I love traveling through the US, international travel has always been number one in my mind, plus I met my wife abroad so I am a little biased. If you are also interested in travel and want to discuss it my email is at the bottom of the page. Happy Trails!</p>
