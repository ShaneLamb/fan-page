        <h2>Why not just take a Staycation?</h2>
        <p>First of all let me say that staycations can be a great way to spend <br> a little time off, however
             I find being away from my home more to my <br> liking. You can argue by definition every time
             we go to work or school <br> that we are traveling so what is the big deal? While this is technically <br>
            travel it is mechanical, souless, unless of course you pass by some great <br> scenery every day for example
             if you lived in Duluth. Travel is a great way <br> to step away from the familiar, meet new people and learn more
             about <br> yourself. If you can find time to get away whether it be locally, across <br> the country, or across the world, then take the chance and make some <br> memories.

        <p id="new">While I love traveling through the US, international travel has <br> always been number one in my mind,  plus I met my wife abroad <br> so I am a little biased. If you are also interested in travel and would <br> like discuss it my email is at the bottom of the page. Happy Trails!</p>
